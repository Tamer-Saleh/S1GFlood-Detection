## :speech_balloon: S1GFloods Dataset Description 

S1GFloods is a new open-source global-scale flood detection dataset. This newly compiled dataset contains global pairs of high-resolution Sentinel-1 SAR images, covering 42 global flood events between 2016 and 2022, along with the ground truth maps for each pixel. The S1GFloods dataset not only includes scenes of flooded areas such as rivers, lakes, vegetation, and urban and rural areas, but also provides samples of the worldâ€™s most common causes of flooding, including heavy rains, overflowing rivers, broken dams, tropical storms, and hurricanes. This comprehensive dataset, essential for decision makers in supporting emergency management authorities and for quantitative assessment of flood disasters, includes elements that are rarely seen in previous datasets.

## :speech_balloon: Network Architecture
An overview of the proposed DAM-Net. The feature maps of the pre-and post-event image pairs are extracted through a Siamese structure and pre-trained remote sensing.

![image-QuantitativeResult](https://github.com/Tamer-Saleh/GFlood-Detection/blob/Flood-Mapping/images/table-test.jpg)

### :point_right: Qualitative Results
A visual comparison of flood detection results in the Iran dataset. The first three images, (a), (b), and (c), represent the pre-flood image,
post-flood image, and binary ground truth, respectively. The subsequent images show a comparison of flood detection using various
methods, including (d) Unet, (e) FC-Siam-Conc, (f) FC-Siam-Diff, (g) SNUNet-ECAM, (h) Siam-Nested-Unet, (i) ResNet50-IMP,
(j) ResNet50-RSP, (k) Swin-T-IMP, (l) ViTAEv2-IMP, (m) Swin-T-RSP, and (n) our proposed DAM-Net method.
